        <button onclick="toggleAccordion(event)">The Scriptures<i class="fas fa-chevron-down"></i></button>
        <p class="closed">
          &emsp;We believe that the Holy Bible as originally written was verbally inspired by God and is inerrant and
          authoritative as the standard of truth. II Timothy 3:16-17; II Peter 1:19-21.
        </p>

        <p class="closed">
          &emsp;We believe there is one and only one living and true God, an infinite Spirit, the Maker and Supreme
          Ruler of
          heaven and earth; that in the unity of the Godhead there are three persons, the Father, the Son, and the Holy
          Spirit, equal in every divine perfection and executing distinct but harmonious offices in the great work of
          redemption. Exodus 20:2-3; I Corinthians 8:6; Revelation 4:11.

      <div class="accordion" id="accordion">
        <button onclick="toggleAccordion(event)">The Holy Spirit<i class="fas fa-chevron-down"></i></button>
        <p class="closed">
          &emsp;We believe that the Holy Spirit is a divine person, equal with God the Father and God the Son and of the
          same
          nature; who seals, endues, guides, teaches, witnesses, sanctifies and helps the believer. John 14:16-17;
          Matthew 28:19; John 16:8-11; Acts 5:30-32; John 3:5-6; Ephesians 1:13-14; Mark 1:8; Acts 11:16; Luke 24:49;
          Romans 8:16, 26.

        <button onclick="toggleAccordion(event)">Jesus Christ<i class="fas fa-chevron-down"></i></button>
        <p class="closed">
          &emsp;We believe that Jesus Christ is God. He was pre-existent and eternal before the incarnation. He is the
          Son of
          God, equal to the Father and the Holy Spirit (Gen. 22:11-15; Ex. 3:2-6; Josh. 5:13-15; Jn 1:1-5; 8:58; Phil.
          2:6; Col. 1:13-17). We believe that Jesus was virgin born and was fully God and fully man. Jesus was God in
          the flesh. We believe that Christ died voluntarily on the cross, suffering in full and paying in full for our
          sins and penalty with His own shed blood, substituting Himself for the sinner, and that He was buried and rose
          again to sit at the right hand of his Father’s throne (Mark 16:19). This offering of Christ as a sacrifice was
          once for all and never to be repeated (Heb. 7:27; 10:1-18).

        <button onclick="toggleAccordion(event)">Salvation<i class="fas fa-chevron-down"></i></button>
        <p class="closed">
          &emsp;We believe that the Triune God saves sinners by grace alone through faith in Christ alone. Faith in
          Christ’s
          substitutionary death on the cross and resurrection from the dead is the only way of salvation and forgiveness
          of sin. We believe that salvation is evidenced through good works that are part of the pursuit of a holy life.
          John 3:16; Ephesians 2:8,9; 1 Corinthians 15:3,4; Romans 3:23, 5:8; 6:23, 10:9; 2 Corinthians 5:17-21.

        <button onclick="toggleAccordion(event)">The Local Church<i class="fas fa-chevron-down"></i></button>
        <p class="closed">
          &emsp;We believe that the universal Church is the body of Christ, comprised of all true believers beginning at
          Pentecost in Acts 2. Jesus Christ is the sole head of the Church.
          <br /><br />
          &emsp;We believe that the local church is an assembly of born-again believers, participating in the Great
          Commission, led by pastors and served by deacons, observing the ordinances of Christ in immersion baptism and
          the Lord’s supper, independent and congregationally governed, in fellowship with other churches of like faith
          and order. Acts 2:41,42; 1 Cor. 11:2; 23-26; 1 Cor. 12:1-4; Eph. 1:22,23; Col. 1:18; 1 Timothy 3; Matt.
          28:19,20.

        <p class="closed">
          &emsp;We believe in the imminent rapture of believers, the premillennial return of Christ, the millennial
          reign of
          Christ on David’s throne, the resurrection of believers to heaven, and the judgment of the wicked to eternal
          condemnation. 1 Thess. 4:13-18; 1 Cor. 15:42-54; Phil. 3:20,21; Is. 9:6,7; Revelation 20.
